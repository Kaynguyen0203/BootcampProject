      <p> Before University, I've had programming experience during my time at sixth form. 
	Computer Science was one of the subjects I've chosen to do. Python was the primary
	language used during the 2 years. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Bullet Hell Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project during University, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project features heavy use of objects and classes. 
	I created a game containing a red square (the player) which can be moved smoothly. It is bound
	within a box. The objective is to survive the incoming bullets from by avoiding them.
	Everything that moves in this program is an object, and the bullets being a collection
	of objects stored in a dynamic array. The player is continuously attacked until their
	health is 0, taking them to the "game over" screen. The time survived is displayed during
	and after the game.
